My Favourite Season “Summer” Essay

Summer is my favourite season of the year.
The weather during this season is very hot. May and June are the hottest months in the year. People use coolers, ACs, etc. to keep the surroundings cool.
The atmosphere in the evening is ideal for outdoor activities like playing, cycling, etc. as there is an ample amount of brightness.
People tend to wear comfortable, light-coloured cotton clothes as cotton is a good absorber of water.
Cold drinks, aam panna, jaljeera, chilled fruit juices are consumed to beat the heat.
It is the season of many fresh fruits and vegetables like watermelon, musk melon, mango, litchi, cucumber, tomatoes, bottle gourd, etc.
The reason why I love this season so much is that during this season, we get summer vacations of around two months.
This is the time to relax with our family members and spend quality time with them without worrying about getting up early for school.
On alternate summer vacations, we visit our village and I get to meet my grandparents and cousins there.
I play with my friends, eat a lot of ice creams, drink fresh fruit juices and watch cartoons during the summer vacations. Summer season is really the best season of the year.
